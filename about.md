Hello, my name is Erin Girard and I’m a user experience designer based in San Francisco.

I kicked off my career working for America’s largest clothing brand, where I ran a $25M product category. It was here that I learned to be an advocate for the consumer, to curate a cohesive brand experience and to drive long-term commercial strategies.

I was thrilled when I discovered the world of User Experience Design. It seemed to be the perfect marriage between my after-hours passion for design and my history with brand-management and customer-experience.

Since transitioning to User Experience Design full-time, I’ve become a detail-oriented designer, passionate about creating user experiences that are as intuitive as they are beautiful.

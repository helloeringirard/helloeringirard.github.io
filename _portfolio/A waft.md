## Waft Aromatics

As many businesses do, Waft Aromatics began as a solution to a personal problem. I discovered essential oils during a particularly stressful time when I was spending as much time staring at the ceiling as I was sleeping at night. I wanted to reserve sleeping pills as a last resort,  so I delved into the world of essential oils and was quickly blown away by how aromatherapy could lull me into a deep and peaceful sleep with no unwanted side effects. 

I started recommending essential oils to friends and family as a first line of defense for their ailments, but quickly realized that none of them were willing to buy and mix the many oils needed. Essential oils had the potential to improve the wellbeing of so many people around me, but the barrier to entry was too high. 

Thus, Waft was born. I wanted my friends and family to have a safe and accessible source for aromatherapy products, and had a hunch that many others out there that felt the same way!

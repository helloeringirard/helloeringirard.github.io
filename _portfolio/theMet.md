## The Problem

Art is trending. With 1.5M sellers on Etsy and $14B spent on Small Business Saturday, makers and artists are the new rock stars. Young people are reevaluating their consumerist tendencies with every article published about the impact of mass-producing items overseas, resulting in a reverence for the masters of art and craft. Artists adept at social media can garner audiences upwards of 100,000 followers while startups aiming to bring one-of-a-kind pieces to young collectors are growing rapidly.

With this newfound appreciation for the handmade, one would expect America’s original authority on art and craft, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to be thriving. In fact, the opposite is true.

The Met’s traffic is down (a quick Google Trends search yields a depressing graph), posing significant challenges for an institution which relies heavily on public donation.

As an art lover, my goal was to help reverse this traffic trend by creating a user experience that is engaging and inspiring, ultimately resulting in increased traffic and donations.

## Goal

Drive user engagement with the Metropolitan Museum of Art by bringing awareness to their incredible content library and event calendar, ultimately increasing membership and donations.

## Process 

### Step 1. Competitive Analysis and User Testing

Competitive analysis revealed lots of areas for improvement. Nearly every major art museum in America was doing a better job of several things: 

1. Providing engaging content (videos, image galleries) to get users excited about visiting the museum<br>
2. Quickly providing the information those visitors need in order to visit the museum<br>
3. Ensuring findability of content. Whether users were looking for a specific piece of art, museum restaurants or children’s resources, information was organized and searchable on other museums’ sites<br>
4. Providing an engaging and effective mobile experience<br>

A card-sort and tree-branch analysis uncovered massive opportunities for optimization. When asked to perform a simple task find the information they’d need in order to visit the museum or to find content related to a specific artist, the vast majority of users were unable to do so.

**Users were asked to complete two tasks: **

1. If you were planning a trip to the Met tomorrow, what information would you seek out? Where would you look for it? <br>
2. Find content related to your favorite kind of art or artist.<br>

Navigation titles were cryptic and search functionality was spotty at best.

My greatest moment of frustration came while performing a content analysis. As I sifted through the site I uncovered INCREDIBLE content: I was taken on a tour of one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s homes, listened to a mother-daughter pair interpret Greek sculpture and filtered an image gallery by the keyword “pleated” (lots of Yves Saint Laurent ensued). There was a treasure trove of inspiring content hiding behind an uninspiring home page and a labyrinth of navigation.

Improving findability (and discoverability!) would be my new mission.

### Step 2. Defining Personas

Extensive studies have been conducted over the past few years in an attempt to pinpoint the causes of the decline in museum traffic. These reports were a gold mine as I sought out to learn more about the typical museum-goer.

**Highlights:** <br>

-    60% of art museum visitors are women. (source)<br>
-    80% of the Met’s visitors are tourists. Of those tourists, 50% are international travelers and 50% are domestic. (source)<br>
-    While 70% of museum visitors today are white, that number will fall below 50% by 2050. (source)<br>

The most alarming statistic I uncovered was the rapidly changing ethnic makeup of the Met’s visitor base. As the current majority slides to the minority, how will museums stay relevant?

In the short term, we could take small steps, like ensuring language translation online and in the museum (check!), but in the long term inclusion of growing ethnic groups will need to go beyond multilingual restroom signs.

Exhibitions will need to be as diverse as the audiences that museums hope to attract, with event programs that introduce new communities to the museum. Museums will need to shed their reputations as elitist, white-dominated institutions, rebranding themselves as inclusive cultural hubs that are dynamic members of the communities around them.

The user personas I developed included racial diversity that would help tailor our user experience to the changing demographic of the museum, a small but important step towards our long-term goals.

### Step 3. Wireframes

Because I had chosen to focus on the task of findability and discoverability, I had two wireframes to create: the homepage and a media hub that would allow users to browse and search for images and videos.

My initial attempt had a few glaring flaws: the home page was be too chaotic once images were placed and the multimedia page was disjointed.

The final wireframes presented homepage content in simple layout that would accommodate diverse imagery and the multimedia hub would allow users to browse or search with ease.

### Step 4. Visual Design

I had two objectives when creating the visual design for the Met:

1. Retain the Met’s image as an authority in the art world while modernizing to make the institution feel more relevant <br>
2. Ensure the visual design didn’t compete or conflict with the wide range of imagery<br>

The color palette was intentionally quite narrow. With all of the visual content that would be featured, graphic elements needed to play a supporting role.

The elements came together to communicate a brand with authority and history while still being modern and accessible.

### Step 5. User Testing

Users were asked to complete two tasks:

1. If you were planning a trip to the Met tomorrow, what information would you seek out? Where would you look for it?
2. Find content related to your favorite kind of art or artist.

I then identified the consistent user problems and generated solutions for each.

>**Problem**: Users wanted to know three things before visiting the museum: hours, ticket prices and what art they should see while they were there. While an itinerary featuring the Met’s Must-See works was featured on the slideshow, none of the users saw it.<br>
<br>
**Solution**: Add ticket prices to home page. Improve visibility of Must-See itinerary slide.

>**Problem**: All users chose “Research” when asked to find content about their favorite type of art. Once they were directed to the Explore section, many wanted to search, which wasn’t an option. <br>
<br>
**Solution**: Rename Explore and Research navigation titles, add search bar to content hub.

>**Problem**: All users expressed a desire to curate their in-person museum experience before arriving at the museum, ensuring that they would see both the Met’s most famous pieces as well as the ones that are most appealing to them.<br>
<br>
**Solution**: Users to create an account and create an itinerary which would be accessible from their cell phone. As they browse exhibitions and images, they can flag items which will them be added to their personal itinerary along with a recommended route and an estimated time needed. Once they arrive at the museum they can open their itinerary on their cell phone, turning their phone into a museum map and audio guide.

### Step 6. Final Product

The Metropolitan Museum of Art is now positioned to achieve its goal of increasing membership and donations. A vast library of videos and images are at the fingertips, ready to convert any casual visitor into an art lover. Logistical information is more accessible than ever and the event calendar is finally getting the attention is deserves. The online experience is nearly as engaging as visiting the museum itself.

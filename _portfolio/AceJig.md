## The Problem

I, like many (many) other city-dwelling, twenty-something, college-educated women in America, have made it a personal mission to be a more conscious consumer. Buying fewer, better things in hopes of decreasing our environmental and social impact on the planet? Sounds like a good plan. But how many times have you tried to support a small business or artist but stopped short of placing an order because of an unpleasant user experience? Those who choose to stray from the familiar womb of Amazon.com are often met with 404 errors, confusing navigation and clunky payment processes.

Take for example, the indie brand Ace & Jig. 

**Pros**:<br> 

Beautifully curated Instagram, full of chic Brooklynites wearing their garments while drinking coffee? check.<br>

Collection debuted on Vogue.com alongside luxury brands? check.<br>

Socially-conscious brand DNA, with yarn-dyed fabric made on handlooms in India? CHECK MATE.<br>

The brand was doing right by our plant and was chic as hell. I needed to join their tribe so that I too could Instagram myself in their double-cloth base pants while drinking an almond cappuccino. But then I discovered their website. 

**Cons**:<br> 
Instead of being met with a home page full of aspirational imagery, I was confronted by 5 lines of text informing me of their domestic, Canadian and international shipping rates and a blurry logo that took up approximately 50% of my screen. 
The color stories that looked so dreamy on Vogue.com looked cheaper against the careless design.
With a one-column layout, my thumb had never been more exhausted by the time I got to the second page of products. And I was only 20% of the way there.

Needless to say, Ace & Jig needed help and I was volunteering for the task force.

## Goal

Improve brand storytelling through more impactful and consistent visual design. Optimize checkout process.

## Process

### Step 1. Competitive Analysis and User Testing

A thorough analysis of the mobile experiences of three competitors, Everlane, Zara and Cienne NY, revealed some glaring opportunities. 

>**Strengths of the Competition:** <br>
<br>
*   Telling compelling brand stories <br>
*   Provide mobile-optimized checkouts<br>
*   Two-column layouts result in more products seen during browsing session<br>
*   Cohesive visual design from home page to checkout provides a sense of legitimacy<br>

>**Weaknesses of the Competition:**<br>
<br>
*   Everlane’s color palette doesn’t invite the user’s eye to be drawn around the page.<br>
*   Zara’s navigation requires that users drill down to the 3rd teir of navigation hierarchy before browsing (ex. Collection SS16 > Woman > Dresses).<br>
*   Cienne NY’s secondary product shots are hidden at the bottom of the page, not immediately apparent to the user.<br>

Based on these observations, I devised a game plan for Ace & Jig. 

>**Opportunities for Ace & Jig:**<br>
<br>
*   Provide additional content about brand’s process and values through additional homepage features.<br>
*   Tell a more impactful visual story through color, typography and graphic elements. <br>
*   Optimize browsing process, increasing number of products per page and improving navigation.<br>
*   Improve conversion by streamlining checkout process and optimizing for mobile.<br>
*   Provide walk-throughs to first-time visitors to introduce the brand.<br>
*   Raise brand awareness through partnerships, high-profile wholesale accounts.<br>

>**Threats to Ace & Jig:**<br>
<br>
*   Lack of existing editorial photography will pose a challenge for visual storytelling on home page.<br>
*   Shopify won’t accommodate all of the changes that need to be made. Must find and implement a new inventory management system.<br>
*   Brand is still relatively unknown to mainstream shoppers.<br>
*   User testing (one-on-one virtual interviews) supported my conclusions. While the site was functional, it wasn’t particularly enjoyable to use.<br>


### Step 2. Wireframes

Inspired by Everlane’s add to cart process, I created an innovative user flow in hopes of driving conversion. As soon the user selected a size, all other clickable items would disappear, subtly drawing the user in towards the shopping cart.

I wanted to get feedback on this flow as quickly as possible, so I created a quick InVision prototype and tested it on a half-dozen users. Unfortunately, most users were confused by the non-traditional approach and abandoned the process altogether. I revised the flow to be more traditional and continued.

### Step 3. Visual Design

Inspired by the Indian handlooms on which Ace & Jig fabrics are woven, delicate geometric elements were threaded throughout the moodboard. Pastel pink and shades of cream would exude warmth, while still providing a neural framework for a wide range of color in imagery and simple, minimal layouts would provide a calming backdrop for intricate fabrics.

### Step 4. User Testing

User testing produced several small opportunities to finesse details, but users were generally able to complete tasks smoothly and quickly. Several problems were identified and solutions devised.

>**Problem**: When asked to browse for dresses, several users looked for a search bar. <br>
**Solution**: Add search functionality. 

>**Problem**: Several users hoped to find a size chart, as this wasn’t a brand they were previously familiar with. <br>
**Solution**: Incorporate size chart into “+INFO” window.

>**Problem**: When asked if they like creating an account in order to expedite future purchases, participants conceded that they find this function to be convenient, but try to avoid it because it leads to them buying more frequently. <br>
**Solution**: While users might avoid creating an account as a budgeting strategy, adding this functionality would likely have a positive impact on sales, therefore, we should add user account functionality. 

### Step 5. Final Product

The new visual design now helps to reinforce Ace & Jig's aesthetic, while the browsing and payment user flows are now faster and more intuitive.

Final, coded prototype coming soon.
